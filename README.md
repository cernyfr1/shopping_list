# Shopping List React App

This app was created as the final project for the React Basics Course hosted by ([Unicorn Systems a.s.](https://unicornsystems.eu/cs/)).

The app provides managable shopping list with the possibilities to add/delete items, check/uncheck the item and set and modify item's content and count.\
The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).\
[ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/) components were used to create the UI.\
To run the application, clone the repository, then in the project directory run the\
`npm install` to install the dependencies and\
`npm start` to start the development server.\
For the application to function correctly the [database API server](https://github.com/goryllaz/ShoppingItemAPI) (provided by the tutor of the course) is also required.
